# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Build a responsive cake shop homepage that showcases six products using the six uploaded images, with a simple details experience and basic site sections in a warm bakery-themed design.

**Planned changes:**
- Create a homepage product grid/list with exactly 6 items: Sponge Cake, Banana Cake, Nuts cookies, Malai Cake, Kitkat chocolate cake, Honey Cake; each card shows the matching uploaded image and name.
- Add a product details view (page or modal/drawer) opened from a product card, showing the product name, a larger version of the same image, and a short generic description, with a close/back action.
- Add a header with site name and navigation links (Home/Products/Contact) that work on desktop and mobile.
- Add a Contact section with placeholder address/phone/email.
- Apply a cohesive bakery-themed visual style (warm cream/caramel/chocolate tones, friendly typography, soft cards, subtle shadows) and avoid blue/purple as the dominant theme.

**User-visible outcome:** Users can browse a responsive list of six cake-shop products with photos, open/close a details view for each item, and navigate to a contact section from the header.
