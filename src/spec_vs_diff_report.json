  "summary": "The diff largely implements the requested cake shop homepage with responsive product grid, product-details dialog, header navigation, contact section, and a warm bakery-themed palette. However, some product display names do not exactly match the user-provided names, and the diff adds unrequested backend/auth scaffolding and a branded footer attribution.",
